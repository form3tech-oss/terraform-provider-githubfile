* Adding a `LICENSE` file to a number of repositories.
* Making sure repositories across an organisation have consistent issue/pull request templates.
* Configuring a tool such as [`golangci-lint`](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) or [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) uniformly across a number of repositories

## Installation

Download the relevant binary from [releases](https://github.com/form3tech-oss/terraform-provider-github-file/releases) and copy it to `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/`.

## Configuration

The following provider block variables are available for configuration:

| Name | Description |

| `commit_message_prefix` | An optional prefix to be added to all commits generated as a result of manipulating files. |
| `github_email` | The email address to use for commit messages.<br>If a GPG key is provided, this must match the one which the key corresponds to. |

Alternatively, these values can be read from environment variables.

## Resources

### `githubfile_file`

The `githubfile_file` resource represents a file in a given branch of a GitHub repository.

| ---- | ----------- |
| `repository_owner` | The owner of the repository. |
| `repository_name` | The name of the repository. |
| `branch` | The branch in which to create/update the file<br>Leaving this empty will cause the file to be created/updated in the default branch. |
| `path` | The path to the file being created/updated. |
| `contents` | The contents of the file. |

#### Example

```hcl
resource "githubfile_file" "form3tech_oss_terraform_provider_githubfile_issue_template" {
    repository_owner            = "form3tech-oss"
    repository_name             = "terraform-provider-githubfile"
    branch                      = ""
    path                        = ".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md"
    contents                    = <<EOF
# Issue Type
